##### Operation Coldstore and its Long Shadow
_Long before I had heard about [Operation Coldstore](https://newnaratif.com/journalism/remembering-coldstore-singapores-former-detainees-speak/), I felt its reverberations in waking moments as a child in school and at home, where there was an acknowledged hush among adults that lived through those critical years. It was and sadly still is in our mileau that we mandate a silence to criticism about the government even if actions or policies in the past or present have been disagreeable._

In February 1963, over 110 people were arrested and detained without trial in Singapore, ostensibly, for posing a communist threat. Against the traditional government narrative, revisionist historians believe these bouts of arrests and imprisonment were unfounded and part of a regime to consolidate political power. 

As a teenager educated in Singapore, such narratives were of little interest to me and drew little contention. Even though now and then there were cynical snickers during Social Studies class about the content being "propoganda", very few of us truly understood the extent of which the syllabus had been rigged. If ever there were complaints about the rigid, rote pedagogy, few of them were raised, at least in my school, in relation to the subject. Individual thought was usurped by the need to remember dates and slogans. But we were happy to go along with it, not completely unaware of the sleight of hand performed right under our noses, but resigned contentment to be more or less, as a whole, obedient students. 

My brush with these questions took a different form at home. When it came time to return from school, my feelings were often ambivalent - half caught in wishing to unwind, and another dreading what commotion might or mightn't be. Living with someone with schizophrenia takes an immense emotional and physical toll on everyone. On bad days, a fervent paranoia built by yells and clanging seized an impressionable mind, as I clamoured for refuge in my room. One of the situations in which schizophrenia presented was with fear about being spied on by members of Special Branch or the Internal Security Department, the same group responsible for "cracking down" on the alleged communists. Every shadow passing along the corridor and filtered through our fogged windows was a sinister threat to the safety of the innocent but damned. Perhaps one day, I shall be keen to share more openly about what it's like to grow up with someone with a mental illness, but such level of detail suffices for now. 

What stood out for me years later, as I gazed upon the undulating features of a hazy past, was how many of these episodes made sense in the historical and present context. It only later dawned on me that the seemingly apolitical Singaporean had emotional ties or views about these issues, even if their fears didn't present with such jarring physicality. With growing public awareness of such historical events, including [Operation Spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBJqJroWt3E), it is with some optimism that I believe Singaporeans will and should work to demand the loosening of government control over its ability to preside as judge, jury, and executioner. While there are some artifacts of our past we might never understand, the trauma faced by our parents and grandparents must resonate with the youths of today.
