    "description": "Long before I had heard about Operation Coldstore, I felt its reverberations in waking moments as a child in school and at home, where there was an acknowledged hush among adults that lived through those critical years. It was and sadly still is in our milieu that we mandate a silence to criticism about the government even if actions or policies in the past or present have been disagreeable.",
